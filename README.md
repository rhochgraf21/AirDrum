# AirDrum
- I wanted to experiment with OpenCV/Mediapipe because I was curious if I could control a midi device with my webcam. 
- So I made AirDrum, a project that uses OpenCV and Mediapipe to enable air drumming from webcam input.
- I interface it with logic pro on my mac, but it can also be used as a generic midi device.
